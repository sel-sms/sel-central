			<p>You have two options to sign up: as a student or as an employer. To share your skills, knowledge, or if you are looking to be hired, create a STUDENT (hyperlink) profile. To find help or learn something new, create an EMPLOYER (hyperlink) profile and start creating your project. As an employer, you can easily search for the skills you desire in a student or the tasks you wish to be completed and choose students who fit the bill. After selecting individuals, you can use their provided contact information to set up the task details. Three steps - it's that easy!</p>
